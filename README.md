# Console program that allows a quiz-creator to create a quiz with any number of questions. 
# After the questions and answers are set, the quiz is presented for the quiz-taker, the the total number of correct responses as well as the number of questions asked are displayed for the user after each question is answered. 

#Let me know if you would have use for an app like this in web application form. I can envision a more complete version of this application that would allow an admin user to assign quiz-maker and student ('quiz-taker') roles, which would mean user authentication would be needed as well. 
#I would be interested in building this with Java using Spring Boot, or Ruby on Rails. As of May 2019, I may be interested in building this application using Angular.
